# Programming in Haskell

Exercises from the book Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton (second edition)

> The new edition uses the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), and is fully compatible with the latest version of the language, including recent changes concerning applicative, monadic, foldable and traversal types.

I will do the exercises with 
*The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.4.4*.
