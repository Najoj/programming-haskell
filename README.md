# programming-haskell
Exercises from the book Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton (second edition)

> The new edition uses the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), and is fully compatible with the latest version of the language, including recent changes concerning applicative, monadic, foldable and treversable types.

I will do the exercises with 
*The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 8.4.4*.

*TODO:* I should do the answers in Markdown for better readability.
