Ex 1. Parenthesise the following arithmetic expressions:
    2 ↑ 3 * 4
    2 * 3 + 4 * 5
    2 + 3 * 4 ↑ 5

Ans 1.
(2 ↑ 3) * 4
(2 * 3) + (4 * 5)
2 + (3 * (4 ↑ 5))

Ex 2. Work through the examples from this chapter using Hugs.
Ans 2.
(Done)

Ex 3. The script below contains three syntactic errors. Correct these errors and
    then check that your script works properly using Hugs.

   N = 1 'div' length xs
        where
            a = 10
           xs = [1,2,3,4,5]
Ans 3.
1. No capital letters at start of function names
2. Parenthesis around length
3. Align where definitions
Ergo:
n = 1 'div' (length xs)
    where
        a = 10
        xs = [1,2,3,4,5]

Ex 4. Show how the library function last that selects the last element of a
    non-empty list could be defined in terms of the library functions introduced
    in this chapter. Can you think of another possible dufiniton?
Ans 4.
last x = drop n x
    where n = (length x)-1
Another solution would be to recursively run last on a list, and when the list
is shourt enough, return the element.

Ex 5. Show how the library function init that removes the last element from
    non-empty list could similarly be defined in two different ways.
Ans 5.
First:
last x = take n x
    where n = (length x)-1
Second:
last x = reverse (drop 1 (reverse x))
